## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn patterns from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning:

### Supervised Learning
- The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).
- **Goal**: Predict the output for new, unseen inputs.
- **Examples**: Classification, Regression.

### Unsupervised Learning
- The model learns from unlabeled data (no predefined outputs).
- **Goal**: Discover hidden patterns or groupings in data.
- **Examples**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.

### Reinforcement Learning
- The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties).
- **Goal**: Learn a policy to maximize cumulative reward over time.
- **Examples**: Game playing, Robotics.

| Term                   | Description                                                                 | Example                    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | Broad field of making machines simulate human intelligence (decision making, reasoning). | Chess-playing programs     |
| **Machine Learning (ML)**       | Subset of AI where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. | Email spam filtering       |
| **Deep Learning (DL)**          | Subset of ML using multi-layer neural networks to automatically learn features from data. | Image recognition, voice assistants |
