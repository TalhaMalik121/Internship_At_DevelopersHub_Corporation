# 🏢 Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation

## 📅 Week 1 Progress

### ✅ What I Learned:

- 📚 Basics of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**
- 🤖 Difference between **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**
- 🧠 Types of Machine Learning:
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
- 📊 Loaded the **Titanic Dataset** and performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**


## 📅 Week 2 Progress Report  

## ✅ What I Learned
### 📌 Supervised Learning Concepts
- Understood the machine learning workflow:  
  🔹 Data Preprocessing  
  🔹 Model Training  
  🔹 Model Evaluation  

- Explored the types of supervised learning models:
  - **Regression**
  - **Classification**

### 🛠️ Hands-On with scikit-learn
- Built and evaluated models using:
  - `train_test_split()`
  - `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.score()`
  - `accuracy_score`, `mean_squared_error`, `classification_report`

### 🔍 Model Implementation
#### 📉 Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset
- Predicted median house prices using multiple features.
- Evaluated performance with:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R² Score**

#### 🌸 Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset (Binary Classification)
- Converted multi-class labels to binary (Class 0 vs. others).
- Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report.

## 🚢 Mini Project: Titanic Survival Prediction
- Built a **logistic regression** model to predict survival.
- Evaluation:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Accuracy Score**
- Visualizations:
  - Confusion matrix heatmap
  - Predicted probability distribution
